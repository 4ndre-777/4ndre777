Oh Terrific.  Here I am barely able to spell the word "code" and already we are talking about a readme file.  My wholw geek life from 1983-2016 was install, run, click, learn, network, cisco, get certified in MSCE x2 and UNIX, LInus, then all the netware shit.  Now retired and doing website and Google My Business.,  etc.  Anyway, a readme file.
Why am I here.  I am just inches away from creatring a PWA out of my websites that constantly score 100 across the bord.  Manifest and serviceworker working fine.
